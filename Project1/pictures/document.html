 <h3>Design process and rationale</h3>
  <p>  <br />
  This project is using current data-visualization techniques to recreate Dr. John Snow's map of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak" >London's 1854 cholera epidemic</a>. The key point of this map is to reveal the significant correlation between contaminative water and cholera, which demonstrated that the pollution of the water pump caused a horrible disease. Therefore, the evidence shown on the data-visualized map can be persuasive to call for the relevant actions to save people’s life.

  </p>  <br />
  <p>The steps to design this project:
  <ol >  <br />
    <li > Analysis of the audience;</li>
    <li >Analysis of the dataset;</li>
    <li>Choose the right charts, channels, and other materials;</li>
	<li>Select a software program;</li>
	<li>Iterative Design process during developing;</li>
	<li>Shared projects with others. </li>

  </ol>
  <p>The audience of this project includes the people who know about this story and the people who never heard about it. It is necessary to contain a document file with short introduction. 
</p>  <br />
<p>The second step is to go through carefully the dataset files. There are three files providing different information for this project
</p>
<p>  <br />
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://khreda.com/teaching/2019/H517/project1/cholera_data/streets.json">Streets.json</a>: provide the coordination of streets to generate John Snow’s Map;</li>
		<li><a href="https://khreda.com/teaching/2019/H517/project1/cholera_data/pumps.csv">Pumps</a>: provide the water pumps coordinates;</li>
		<li><a href="https://khreda.com/teaching/2019/H517/project1/cholera_data/deathdays.csv">Deathdays</a>: provide the death date and deaths on that day;</li>
		<li><a href="https://khreda.com/teaching/2019/H517/project1/cholera_data/deaths_age_sex.csv">Death_age_sex</a>: provide demographic information of the deaths.</li>
	</ul>
	
</p>  <br />
<p>My initial design sketch (see picture1) consists of a John Snow’s map displaying the location of the water pump and the people's death location. I planned to add a bar chart to show the death number along with the time went by.
</p>  <br />
<p>According to history, the death number increased suddenly in a short time and should decrease quickly after the particular day in which the government moved the water pump. Therefore the bar chart should show this tendency.  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Death points color and shape</h4>
  <p>
  To distinguish the different age groups, I used the gradient ramp generated by the ColorBrewer2. The color is selected because the red color reminds people to think of the blood and the brighter yellow can represent life. I chose the dark red, the color of blood,  as the color of the bar chart because its value represents the death number of people per day.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Pump shape</h4>
  <p>
  Based on the real water pump in the London street in history, I select a water-pump icon to indicate the water pump location on the map. My selection is based on its shape and color. Compared to my map background color, the icon that I chose has distinguished color from map and denotes they are pump intuitive. 
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Buildings color and street name</h4>
  <p>
  Green, the color of life, I used green color to denotes the two exceptional cases that led Snow to isolate the cause of the cholera to the Broad Street pump. 
  <br />
  For instance, of the 530 inmates of the Poland Street workhouse, which was only round the corner, only five people had contracted cholera;

  but no one from the workhouse drank the pump water, for the building had its own well.

  Among the 70 workers in a Broad Street brewery, where the men were given an allowance of free beer every day and so never drank water at all, there were no fatalities at all.
  </p>

 


  
  <h4>Color test</h4>
  <p>
  Here are the color scheme generated by ColorBrewer2. 
  </p>
  <h4>Distribution graph of deaths by sex and age overall</h4>
   <p>At first, I plan to use an icon to distinguish males and females. However, considering that I also want to distinguish their age on the map, I want to keep the map a little bit simple and straightforward without too many flaring icons. I just chose two different shapes to distinguish gender and filled with different colors to denote their age.

  <h3>Questions & Findings</h3>  <br />
  <h4>Q1. Was the death really caused by water pollution?</h4>
  <p>From John Snow’s map, we can find a clear correlation between death and water pump(see below picture). The dead were concentrated near water pumps.
</p>  <br />
  <img src="Q1-1.png" width="70%" height="70%"></img>
  <p style="text-align: center;color: black;"></p>
  <img src="Q1-2.png" width="70%" height="70%"></img>
  <p style="text-align: center;color: black;"></p>
  <br />
  <h4>Q2.  What age group was dying the most?</h4>
  <p>The pie chart shows the proportional distribution of age groups. The largest portion of the dead population is young children less than 10 years and old people above 60-year-old. It is reasonable because older people and children have weaker immune systems.</p>

   <br />
  <img src="Q2-2.png" width="70%" height="70%"></img>
  <p style="text-align: center;color: black;"></p>
  <br />
  <h4>Q3.What else can you find from this data-visualization? </h4>
<p>*There is no significant difference between the death of gender;

<h3> Acknowledgment </h3>
<p>
	Thanks a lot to my friends’ help in this project.
	<br /> My friend Shuxian shared her design idea and cleaned dataset with me and I used her design idea for John Snow’s map outline. 
	<br /> Thanks to my friend Kai who help me deal with all the datasets with Python. 
	<br /> With their JSON format dataset, I saved a lot of time and could focus on the coding without worrying too much about the data issue. 
	<br /> Thanks to my friend Yuan who helped me with the development environment issue and debug. 
	<br /> Thanks to my friend Allen, who assist me to conduct a great improvement of code structure on my original code and contribute solutions for the javascript problems that I met. 

</p>
